# Sudoku-Solver
In this repository, i have built the algorithm to solve sudoku.Using java programming language.
Time complexity: O(9^(n*n)). 
For every unassigned index, there are 9 possible options so the time complexity is O(9^(n*n)).
Space Complexity: O(n*n). 
To store the output array a matrix is needed.
